# About

Board Explorer lets you turn any static chess board (like youtube videos and pictures) into a playable chessboard. You can play
your lines and check the evaluation. You're also able to view the evaluation while the game is being played. Under the hood, we locally record
(only on your computer) your screen and use an image recognition model (powered by yolov5) to identify the boards.

Board Explorer was trained on an 8000+ image synthetic dataset generated by [Dama](https://github.com/ReedKrawiec/DaMa).
